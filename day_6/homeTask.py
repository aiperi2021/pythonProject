# Task 1 write the program where is List of numbers,ex num= [1,2,4,6,3,5,6...]
# loop it and
# if there EVEN number multiply by 2
# if  there odd numbers multiply by 3
# print


# Task 2 write the program where list of numbers, ex num= [1,2,4,6,3,5,6...]
# loop it and find maximum number in the list and prit it out

# Task 3 write the program where list of numbers, ex num= [1,2,4,6,3,5,6...]
# loop it and find sum of numbers ex : 1+2+4+6+3+5+6 = 27

# Task 4 write the program where given integer number, ex: num2 = 3
# create while loop where it will check if num2 == 10 print ("Number is found")

# Task 5 write the program where String name = 'python' loop it and count how many letters in it
